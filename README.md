# FBCC Production
First Baptist Church of Centerville (FBCC) uses a multitude of software and technical components on a day-to-day basis in the Worship Center. This repository is an effort to centralize setup and maintenance instructions to avoid knowledge siloing.

# Sofware Components
## Resolume Arena
Used to layer video and NDI components that get pushed to the Audience Projectors.

## Planning Center
Used to plan events (sermons, funerals, special, etc.) that populate Pro Presenter as well as determine who will be involved in those events.

## Pro Presenter 7
Used to organize the different images, song lyrics, and other manually orchestrated media that gets pushed to the Audience and Confidence Projectors.

## Stream Deck
Elgato Stream Decks are used to control steaming and Resolume Area. In some cases, Elgato's Stream Deck software is used to program and interface with these Decks.

## Bitfocus Companion
In cases where OSC messages need to be sent, as is the case with Resolume Arena, Bitfocus Companion is used to program and interface with the Stream Decks.

## Wirecast
Used to record and stream different events.

## Vista Lighting
Closed Network system that allows people in the Sound Booth to control the lighting within the Worship Center.

## Spotify
Used to play music before and after events.

# Technical Components
## Projectors
FBCC's Worship Center is equipped with seven projectors. Six of the projectors push the displays that those sitting in the seats can see (Audience Projectors), while the seventh pushes the song lyrics and other media those on the Stage need to see (Confidence Projector).

## Cameras
There are two cameras that are used to record and stream the different events.

## Computers
In an effort to avoid and limit technical issues, FBCC uses six computers to distribute the compute power needed for different applications:
- Resolume
- Pro Presenter
- Streaming
- Lighting
- Loops
- Music

## Allen & Heath SQ-7 Soundboard
All audio that gets played in the Worship Center goes through an Allen & Heath SQ-7 soundboard.

## Matrox Boxes
Two Matrox boxes are used to extend two Display outs from the Resolume graphics card in order to push to the six Audience Projectors.
